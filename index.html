      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi there! I graduated from UW-Eau Claire with a bachelors of applied physics degree. I worked at 3M as a contractor and now work at Medtronic. What else to say? Hmm.. Well! I've never left the Americas, so traveling to Europe is one of my goals once the pandemic ends.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Andover, MN originally.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am into photography, playing video games, vollyeball, and I work on my own video game at times. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something that is hands-on where I can craft with my team. I like problem solving and developing fixtures. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I moved back to Andover, MN after a series of events. I was going to move elsewhere, but then the pandemic hit, so I thought it best to wait it out.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm not done growing yet. Coding/programming are interests of mine, and more computer science jobs will develop as the years continue. </p>
